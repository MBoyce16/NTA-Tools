# NTA-Tools
A collection of tools developed to aid in the analysis of non-targeted data


## How to use these tools:
### From the script:
Import the modules into your own python scripts to use the different functions

### From CLI:
Call the scripts from command line and pass the necessary arguments
e.g.: $ python mzXML_to_csv -file Absolute-file-path

### As a packaged .EXE:
Use the pyinstaller packager to bundle a script into a .exe so you don't need Python or its dependencies
